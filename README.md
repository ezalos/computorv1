# ComputorV1

This project solve quadratic equations, and can display visual interpretation

## Getting Started

* ```pip3 install requirements.txt --user```
  * It will install the required packages for the project
* executing: ```python3 computorv1.py "123 * X^0 + 420 * X^1 - 69 * X^2 = 42"```
  * This allows you to execute the program
* usage:
  * ```usage: python3 computorv1.py  [-v or --visual]  [-h or --help] "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"```

## Options

* ```-v```  Visual
  * Display the equation in 2D (or 3D when complex) with matplotlib
* ```-h```  Help
  * Display usage

## Tests

```test.py``` file contains different example of equations, which are used to test ```computorv1.py```
